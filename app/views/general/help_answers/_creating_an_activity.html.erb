To create a new activity, navigate to the "Activities" tab in the navbar. Here, you will be presented with
a calendar view of all activities. You then press the blue rectangular button in the top right corner of the 
screen that says "New Activity".

<%= image_tag "help/newactivitybutton.png", alt: "New Activity Button Location", class: "img-fluid" %>

You then will be shown a form asking for the activity's information. After you have filled out the form with
your event's details you scroll down to the bottom and click the blue rectangular button at the bottom left
corner that says "Create Activity".

Keep in mind that this form automatically generates a passcode for the event so do remember to save that
passcode for the club members to use when the event begins.
