To create an article, you must first be logged in as an admin. Once you are logged in, you will see a
"New Article" button at the top right corner of the articles page. Click on that button and you will be
redirected to a form where you can fill out the article's information.

You can fill out the article's category and module along with a title and the content. Once you are done,
click on the "Create Article" button at the bottom of the form and the article will be created.
