You can check your points in two places:

First, on the "Home" tab, which is typically the first page you see after logging in. 
Your points are displayed in the top left corner, just below the navigation bar.

Second, within your profile. To access it, click on either your name or profile picture
in the top right corner of the navigation bar and select "Profile" from the dropdown
menu. On your "User Profile" page, your total points are visible on the right side, 
beneath the area where you clicked on your profile picture and name.
