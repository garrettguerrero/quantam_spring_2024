To register for an activity, begin by navigating to the "Activities" tab on the navigation 
bar. You'll be given the option to view activities in either a calendar or list formatâ€”choose
your preference at the top of the page. Next, locate the activity you wish to attend and click
on it to visit its dedicated page. There, press the "Verify Attendance" button, which will
prompt a pop-up where you're required to enter the activity passcode. This passcode will
have been provided to you by an officer.

For officers, the activity password is available in two places: firstly, it can be found in
the form used to create the activity; secondly, it appears when you click the "Edit" button
on the activity's page, located at the bottom of the form.
